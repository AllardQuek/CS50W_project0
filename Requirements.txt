Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:

Your website must contain
- at least four different .html pages #
- possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks. #

Your website must include at least
- one list (ordered or unordered), #
- one table, #
- one image. #
- one stylesheet file. #

Your stylesheet(s) must use at least
- five different CSS properties, (text-align, font-size, text-decoration, font-family, color) #
- five different types of CSS selectors. (attribute#, child#, descendant#, pseudoclass, pseudoelement) #
- #id selector and the .class selector #
- one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens. #


You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, (alert, bootstrap#, buttons#, columns#)
- taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component,
- and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model. (columns) #

Your stylesheets must use at least
- one SCSS variable #
- one example of SCSS nesting and inheritance each. #

In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.




Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops. #
