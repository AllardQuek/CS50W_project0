            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p class="about">Hi! I am Allard Quek, 19, from Singapore. </p>
            <p class="interest">My interests range from sports to music and reading. I especially like classical music and the post-hardcore genre. My favourite instrument is the french horn because of its rich and warm tone.</p>
            <p class="future">I hope to pick up some new skills after NS, such as basketball, playing the piano, driving and programming. Pursuing such interests should occupy me for the time period before my admission NUS studying Computer Science with a Second Major in Stattistics.</p>
